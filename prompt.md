Here is some corrected code; the problem was that I was counting the wrong events. I still think they are all timed correctly ... Can you change this code to two funtions:  one  that accepts arguments for beta, pop and finTime and returns the list trans; and one that accepts a trans list and returns the count object. Please add some break logic for finTime. Also, what's the easiest way to disable finTime checking when calling? Does python support a value of infinity? Does it support passing NULL values (or leaving values out, like R does)?

I'm going to give you an edited version of your code; please respect my conventions (tab indent, short lines, short comments). I would like to change finTime to reportTimes. Record the report time, C and I when the report time is passed. End if you reach the last reportTimes value, allow reportTimes=none. Return a list containing the trans object and the orbit object. What is a good choice for the structure of the orbit object?
